# Auto-Complete Component

This project is a React component that implements an auto-complete input field. The component uses TypeScript, React, and Redux and is built entirely using functional components with hooks. It uses mock data for the auto-complete suggestions, but the function that filters the data simulates an asynchronous REST API call. The CSS styling is basic, but functional.
